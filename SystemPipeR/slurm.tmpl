## Job Resource Interface Definition
##
## ntasks [integer(1)]:       Number of required tasks,
##                            Set larger than 1 if you want to further parallelize
##                            with MPI within your job.
## ncpus [integer(1)]:        Number of required cpus per task,
##                            Set larger than 1 if you want to further parallelize
##                            with multicore/parallel within each task.
## walltime [integer(1)]:     Walltime for this job, in minutes.
##                            Must be at least 1 minute.
## memory   [integer(1)]:     Memory in megabytes for each cpu.
##                            Must be at least 100 (when I tried lower values my
##                            jobs did not start at all).
##
## Default resources can be set in your .BatchJobs.R by defining the variable
## 'default.resources' as a named list.

## For MPI use something like
## <%
## cmd = "R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore"
## if(ntasks > 1L)
##   cmd = paste("mpirun -np 1", cmd)
